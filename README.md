### Conclusion
<br>
<br>
I have spent many evenings in the front of my desktop with anger as I have not fully practise with indiviual modules and bet on my previous knowledge about Matplot, seaborn Panda and other libraries. That seems to be biggest mistake as very often i have spent time on dataframe manipulation or fixxing errors. Due to time constraint i coudn't work on third algorithm. Its always difficult to find right balance between education, work and family time. I believe i could do better however there has been lots of variables (moving to new country, new job and kids settling in new enviroment) particularlly in this last 3 months.
